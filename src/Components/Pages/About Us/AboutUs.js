                <p>In this difficult and uncertain time, HealmatesBD remains committed to serving the rider and the riding community while continuing to act responsibly to ensure the safety of our customers and employees. We know many of you are commuting as a part of essential services and jobs while others are practicing safe social distancing on a solo ride (where permitted). 

We are here to help keep you on two wheels (safely) and provide the best service possible. While our employees practice safe habits working remotely (where able), our customer service continues to be available during all of our normal hours, so if you've got a need - we're here to help.</p>

            <p>
            HealmatesBD was founded in 2007 by a core team of riders whose sole goal was to bring the best possible shopping experience to any enthusiast who visits us, in-store or online. Over the next decade, we continuously smashed records, raked in awards, and, most importantly, helped keep hundreds of thousands of new and experienced riders safe and sound. Now, as part of the Comoto Family of Brands, HealmatesBD continues its mission to serve the rider, fuel the industry, and inspire the community.

At HealmatesBD, we know that a large and rider-specific product selection is a commodity within the world of motorcycle gear and parts web sites. There is a lot of competition out there and to an extent we all have overlapping product selections. We hope our straightforward and fair customer approach differentiates us from the pack and speaks to how serious we are about putting our customer's satisfaction as our number one priority.

For us, the customer always comes first and we do our darndest to make sure that each customer has an experience which is exemplary of our brand.

You can find compliments from past customers (as well as some complaints!) by reading reviews of HealmatesBD at ResellerRatings.com. We cherish any and all customer feedback; if there is something we can do better, we want to know!

We hope that you enjoy shopping with us now and in the future.

<br />
Sincerely,
<br />
Anthony, Nick, Matt and the rest of the HealmatesBD Team

                <p>All HelmatesBD helmets are designed in France using cutting edge technologies. Riders are at the center of our product creation process. “Design for a Function” is our motto: each line, each curve, each function must serve a purpose which makes our products so unique and innovative. <br /> <br />

We develop new models by relying on advanced studies carried out in the field of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) to improve riding comfort, optimize ventilation and improve aerodynamics. These CFD studies enable us to eliminate buffeting effects at high speed and reduce noises. All of our newly-released models are equipped with Optical Class 1-rated visors featuring variable thicknesses (from 4.2 mm to 2.8 mm) free of any visual distortion.</p>
